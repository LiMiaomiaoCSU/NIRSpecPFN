# NIRSpecPFN
***
This is the code repo for the paper **Precise Modeling of Scarce Near-Infrared Spectral Data Based on TabPFN**.We developed a method for Near-Infrared Spectral Analysis.This is a supervised machine learning approach based on the [TabPFN](https://github.com/PriorLabs/TabPFN), which is a Transformer-Based model. NIRSpecPFN strictly adheres to structured machine learning methodologies, with the framework integrating key steps such as data preprocessing, feature selection, and modeling prediction.

# Package required
***
The entire process of this experiment was implemented in Python 3.12.9.TabPFN v2 requires Python 3.9+ due to newer language features.
